# Phase-1-Project

This project features several cards with kittens via a db.json file used to emulate the JSON server. 

Each card has been assigned a "like" button, which can be used to add or remove kitten cards from the "favorite kittens" div at the bottom of the page by clicking the "like" button (using a click event).

Additionally, you can sort the kittens by fur color via a dropdown menu, with a connected change event listener, at the top of the page, narrowing down your favorite kitten pictures even further!

For some added flair, the title "Kittens!" at the top of the page has both a mouseover and mouseout event listener attached to it that changes the color from black to purple and back as you hover with the mouse pointer.
